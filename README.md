# Live Caption App for Linux

[English](./README.md) / [Êó•Êú¨Ë™û](./README_JA.md)

This application recognizes all audio played on your PC in real time  
and displays subtitles (captions) on the screen.

It is inspired by the "Live Caption" feature available on Android.

## ‚ú® Features

- Capture all audio output from the system (videos, music, calls, etc.)
- Real-time subtitles using the Vosk speech recognition engine
- Supports partial recognition for ultra-low latency caption updates
- Always-on-top caption window with customizable positioning
- Safe termination by pressing Ctrl+C twice


## üñ• System Requirements

- Linux (**PipeWire or PulseAudio** environment)
- Python 3.10 or higher recommended
- Monitor source available (e.g., `alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1f.3.analog-stereo.monitor`)


## üõ† Installation

1. Clone this repository.

2. Install the required packages.

    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```

3. Check the monitor source device index.

    ```bash
    poetry run python scripts/monitor_device.py
    ```

4. Set the correct `MONITOR_DEVICE_INDEX` in `main.py`.


## üöÄ How to Run

```bash
poetry run python main.py
```

- A caption window will appear pinned to the top of your screen.
- Subtitles will update in real time according to the audio output.


## üõë How to Exit

- Press **Ctrl+C twice** to safely terminate the application.
- Resources will be properly released without freezing.

## üß™ Running Tests

```bash
poetry run python -m unittest discover -v
```

The tests use simple mocks and do not require audio devices or Vosk models.


## ‚öôÔ∏è Planned Future Enhancements

- [ ] **Toggle device microphone**
- [ ] **Customizable caption styles** (font, color, size, transparency, etc.)
- [x] **Text wrapping and multi-line caption support**
- [ ] **Switchable speech recognition engines (e.g., Whisper.cpp support)**
- [ ] **Multilingual captions (automatic language switching and translation)**
- [ ] **GUI tool for adjusting caption window position and size**
- [ ] **Click-through (mouse pass-through) mode for the caption window**
- [x] **Fade-out and auto-hide options when audio is not detected**


## üõ° Notes

- Recognition accuracy depends on the Vosk model used.  
  For higher accuracy, consider using larger models or switching to different engines.
- This application works entirely locally; no audio data is sent externally.
